# DIY GPIO EAS Switching Relay

__Parts List Open Broadcaster EAS Relay__

Kit with diagram and assembly photos of a complete RS232 GPIO Switching Relay .  Special Thanks to [Pippin Technical](http://pippintech.com/) supplier of parts in a kit form if that has any appeal for around $150 or the completed switching relay.  Full assembly takes 2 +/- hours for all mounting, cable prep, soldering and testing with the OB Alert Player. Might take a bit longer for groups that have never built one before. Get a group together for a DIY maker space hands on training project.

# DIY Hall of Fame

## Switching Relay

Dave Currie of Faith FM Waterloo Ontario made this really professional EAS setup using a Intel NUC and a custom relay.  Nice work Dave!

## 20 Db Annenuation

Why bother buying a 15.00 inline adaptor when you can make it yourself with a few parts and a soldering iron.

‘H’ or ‘T’ pads may also be fabricated to accomplish the same level of attenuation.For a balanced signal, use an H-Pad: input_impedance=30k Ω, output_impedance=10k Ω. The example below provides approximately -20dB of attenuation using resistors R 1/2= 12k Ω; R 2=3.3k Ω; R 3/2=3.3k Ω (ground wires should also be connected).
